## About the App
![Example of live coding an app in Streamlit|635x380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/docs/main/public/images/Streamlit_overview.gif)

* The code is using the Streamlit and Pandas libraries to create a web application that allows a user to either upload a file, provide a link to a file, or generate a default file. 
* The file can be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format. 
* The user can then choose to profile either all of the variables in the file or a selected subset of them, and can also choose between a "minimal" and "complete" mode for the profiling.
* The code then creates an editable grid using the AgGrid library to display the data. 
* The user can then pin, edit, and profile columns in the grid. 
* Finally, the code creates a profile report using the pandas_profiling library and displays it using the st_profile_report function from the streamlit_pandas_profiling library.

## What is streamlit 

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app!

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

Streamlit can also be installed in a virtual environment on [Windows](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-windows), [Mac](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux), and [Linux](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux).

## Run the app using DockerFile
### Build a Docker image
The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile . Run the following command from the app/ directory on your server to build the image:

```bash
docker build -t streamlit .
```

The -t flag is used to tag the image. Here, we have tagged the image streamlit. If you run:

```bash
docker images
```
You should see a streamlit image under the REPOSITORY column. For example:
```bash
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
streamlit    latest    70b0759a094d   About a minute ago   1.02GB
```

### Run the Docker container
Now that you have built the image, you can run the container by executing:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit
```
The -p flag publishes the container’s port 8501 to your server’s 8501 port.

If all went well, you should see an output similar to the following:
```bash
$ docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit
  
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  URL: http://0.0.0.0:8501
```
To view your app, you can browse to http://0.0.0.0:8501 or http://localhost:8501
